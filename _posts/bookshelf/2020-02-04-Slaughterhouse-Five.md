Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse 5 also known by it's underappreciated alternate name *The Children's Crusade* is an anti-war book. It was written in 1969 during the Vietnam War but it talks about the World War II, the air-raid on Dresden and it's tragedy. We follow Billy Pilgrim who as he describes it, has come *unstuck in time* which causes him to jump between his past, present and future self. Also he gets captured by aliens.

John Green in his Crash Course Literature Videos [^1] [^2] talks at length about the book, and it's through these that I was able to better understand the book.

To be honest, I don't really have a lot of thoughts about the book. I read the work casually and did not give it the attention it required of me.

I will read this book again, once I have seen more of life, read more books and lived a little, maybe then I'll come to appreciate all the subtleties and nuances of Vonnegut's work.
