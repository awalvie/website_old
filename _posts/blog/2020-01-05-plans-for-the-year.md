The last 2 years of my life have mostly been a blur, for reasons that I might later get into in some other post, but I've tried to take up some good habits and got rid of some really bad ones, but I haven't been successful in consistently practicing them and integrating them into my life, so, this post will talk about the things that I would like to achieve and the habits that I'd like to practice this year so that I might have a better and happier time in life.

### Habits

- Exercise

I wanted to go trekking this past December and exercised in the morning to get fit for the trip, sadly the trip never happened but I had a fantastic time running in the morning. I did not do a whole lot of upper body exercise which I wish to include going furthur.

- Reading

I had a great time reading books last year and listening to Dr. Jordan Peterson's course on [Personality](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22J3VaeABQApSdW8X71Ihe34eKN6XhCi), unfortunately I read very inconsistently and wasn't able to read more than 10 books, reading 30 minutes on weekdays and 1-2 hours on the weekends sounds like a great time to me.

- Meditating

I got a yearly subscription to Sam Harris's [Waking Up](https://wakingup.com/) app on meditation and sparing 10 minutes a day is hardly an issue.

- Waking up early

I've been consistently waking up between 3:30 - 4:30 for the past 3-4 Months now and that's a habit I wish to continue doing.

- Journaling

I found out about Bullet Journaling which seemed like a perfect way to both track my habits and To-Do's on paper, I tried to use apps in the past, but I never really stuck to them, there's just something about writing things down on paper that really works for me.

### Goals

- GSOC 2020

I failed miserably the last time I applied for GSOC but am determined to get through it this year.

- Perform well in placements

Going to have college placements this year and obviously really want to do well in them.

- Trek and explore places

I missed my opportunity to trek last year but really want to go this year. it's this fever that has gripped me since November which has me looking every now and then on Amazon and Decathlon to slowly buy all the gear necessary for the trip.

That's all the things that I could come up with, I've tried to keep the goals realistic and achievable and my habits that are both useful and genuinely fun.
