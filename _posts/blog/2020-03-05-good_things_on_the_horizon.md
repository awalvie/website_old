### Good Things

Writing this while waiting for my flight to Goa. I'll be attending NULLCON with some friends. I feel nervous and ecstatic. It's been 5-6 years since I've taken a trip and the first time I'm on my own. Having lived in hostels for 4 years now you'd think I'd have explored my own country a little at least but hey, everyone starts somewhere. 

I had been bummed out when I couldn't go to Nepal for Hiking last December, a real punch in the gut for me. It was a family emergency, couldn't do anything about it. This trip to Goa is not a replacement for it. I still dream of climbing the peaks. I will climb those peaks. The purpose of the hike was to discover myself and achieve something that I cared about, away from the touch of technology in the wild and serene wilderness of the mountains. Find peace, comfort and clarity. The trip to Goa in some ways is a way of breaking out of my shell and doing something that's given me major problems in the past few years, social anxiety and facing it head-on. It's harder to find people who share an interest in the same things, which has led to social disconnection over the past few years. Reading difficult literature has led to a massive shift in perspective. I still don't have a clear picture of where I'm headed but I am confident that I can make the right decisions to lead a life that I deem worthwhile. I am looking forward to finding friends, having fun and living a little during the next 4 days.
