#### consistency with weekly updates

I have not been writing my weekly developer blogs. The reason is the same as mentioned in the previous post. It's because I don't have a lot of things that I do to write about. So from this week on, I will ensure that I write a development blog post every Sunday. Actions speak louder than words and that's the only way I can really prove myself.
