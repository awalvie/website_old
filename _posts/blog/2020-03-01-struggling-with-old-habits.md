### So much for updates

As with last time, I've mostly put off updating my blog because I've failed to meet the standards that I have set for myself. I've been struggling with my addictions of YouTube and Dota 2 and it's difficult to get any work done. I haven't been living a healthy lifestyle either. I promise myself everyday that I'll be better tomorrow but procrastination and pleasure always get the better of work. I've just not been feeling very well. Words don't come to me as easily as they do on other days. I'll be back when and if I can fix myself.
