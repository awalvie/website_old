Two weeks late I know, but let's get on with it!

### Learning Rust

I've been learning Rust this past week. I finally decided that Rust was the language that I would use for my GSOC projects, and because it's a systems language you can't just pick it up in a week or so. It's better to decide, than to mull over options. At least I am making some quantifiable progress and have a trajectory.

The language is really neat!

### YouTube and DOTA 2

I've spent 1400 hours on DOTA 2 in-game, and countless more on YouTube videos. It's a problem I've been struggling with for the last 4-5 years, hours just pass me by if I even watch a single video or play a single game. The worst part is, that I hate myself after. It's precious time, completely wasted.

I had been away from both of these in December and was making good progress in trying to get rid of these habits, but January saw me shifting back to my old ways. It's a must that I get away from these ASAP as this is a very important year for me, and I want to finally achieve something worthwhile.

Some days of this week were just me watching YouTube videos all day after University and then going to sleep, feeling terrible afterward, promising myself that I would do better the next day, only to repeat the cycle.

So that's my main objective for the coming week, resist things that make me feel worse and waste my time. Reading *12 Rules for Life* has been very helpful in figuring out problems that I face and not just accept their existence but actively try to find solutions to them.

### Honesty

It's imperative that I am honest about whatever I write here, and that I learn to accept failures. I did not write the entries for the first 2 weeks simply because I had been unsuccessful with my habits, had not done anything productive with my time and felt ashamed about it. Setting lofty goals for the future is easy to do, but following through is what counts. Working when nobody is watching, simply because of your commitment to yourself is a difficult thing to get good at.

I did not want to admit responsibility for my failings and did not dare to look myself in the eye.

**I'll fix it next week**

This is the ideology that I've always had when I fuck up. I did not try to understand and evaluate what was fundamentally wrong with my habits and actions that were making me feel worse about myself. I've lied to myself over and over for a huge chunk of my life, and it's gone from conscious deception to unconscious belief in my lies. I have always tried to put off trying to understand myself because I know I'm not going to like who I am as a person fundamentally. It's *12 Rules* and *Peterson's* lectures that have convinced me that enough is enough and that I should really start taking responsibility for myself, and I do not say that lightly.

Writing these weekly updates and being brutally honest in them, I think, is a good start.
