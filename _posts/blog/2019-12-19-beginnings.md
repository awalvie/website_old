I'd like to define the purpose of this website by answering the questions above,

#### Why am I doing this

I don't talk a lot, but I do think constantly, often I'm not able to atriculate what I'm thinking. Wrting as suggested by Dr. Jordan Peterson on multiple occasions [#](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOXwDWCoqQg&t=66s), [#](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkc5Fl0E8uU&t=24s), [#](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfDOoADCfkg) seems to be a great way to get better at it, I've also been enjoying reading and will be posting my thoughts about the books here. So the goals are as following:

- Log weekly activity
- Better articulate my thoughts
- Talk about books
- Track my projects

#### What the results might be

There is nothing to loose and so much to gain, being consistent and forming good habits is the key to living a great life in my opinion, in the short run this would be a way for me deal with my  anxity and depression because this very much feels like talking to a friend, and I'd have something to look forward to every day, as I need to stay accountable and be productive instead of procrastinating all day long and then write about it in the day's log. In the long run, the habit's which I form and the work I've done might finally bring me some sense of satisfaction and accomplishment which has been missing for a long time.

#### Will I be successful

It does'nt take a  lot of time to log my daily work and these entries provide me a cathartic feeling, it's the principle of **Minimum Viable Effort**, the more simple and easy the task the more inclined you are to do it, and that's what I'm betting on to keep coming back and writing.

in summary, this is simply another attempt at making myself happy.
