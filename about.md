hi, I'm awalvie, also known as vishesh in the real world and welcome to my little corner on the internet. I am starting this blog as a way of motivating myself into making meaningful contributions to open source software, improve my writing skills (which you will be noticing throughout the blog are completely garbage) and being consistent.

my weekends start with a nice
{% highlight shell %}
mkdir super_awesome_project
{% endhighlight %}
and end with
{% highlight shell %}
rm -rf ./super_awesome_project
{% endhighlight %}

The social skills I lack (as pointed out by my parents), I like to think I make up for by having a high amount of curiosity, love for computers and addiction to coffee. I am always interested in talking to people to share ideas and solve problems, so hit me up on twitter anytime.

I also like reading books and will be writing about them, these won't be reviews but just my thoughts put on paper.
